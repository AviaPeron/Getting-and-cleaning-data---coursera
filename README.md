# Getting-and-cleaning-data---coursera

this repo is the 'Getting and cleaning data' cours project.
the project focus on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" -  experiment have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

## the project

The original dataset included data files about trains and tests that both of them contain Training set, Training labels and ID's of subjects in the training data (separately). In addition the data set included list of all features and list of the activity names.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

the R script with explenation about what I did there is in the `run_analysis.R` file.
The `CodeBook.md` describes the variables.
The The output of the last step is in the `AllDatNam.txt` file.
